# MY-landing-page-project
This is a landing page project I did for Udacity web dev program 
It has some features like: 
1) navigation bar that navigate through sections.
2) When a section is pressed the bar scroll us smoothly to reach it.
3) when we reach a section it's active (by scrolling or pressing the nav bar) 
this is the 1.0.0 version
